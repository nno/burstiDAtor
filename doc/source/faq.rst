Frequently Asked/Anticipated Questions
======================================

- Why is the program called 'burstiDAtor'?
    + It is a reference to 'Trogdor the Burninator', a character in the Homestar Runner series. The capitalization of 'DA' refers to dopamine, a neurotransmitter released by cells of which the neural burst response profiles can be analyzed using burstiDAtor. 

      Earlier versions were named 'Vucmoore the burstiDAtor', which rhymes better with 'Trogdor'. For reasons of simplicity, amongst other things, it was shortened to its current name.

.. _`burst_detection`:

- How is a burst detected?
    + Assuming spikes have already been detected using another program (such as Spike2), bursts can be detected according dopamine (DA) or serotonin (5HT) criteria. 
    
        - For dopamine, a burst is defined according to the criteria proposed by [GB84]_. A burst start when two consective spikes have are less than 80 ms apart. Every subsequent spike less than 160 ms from the previous spike is part of the burst, too. A burst ends when two consecutive spikes are more than 160 ms apart.
        - For serotonin the procedure is the same, but the numbers are 20 ms and 20 ms (as proposed by [HAJ07]) instead of 160 ms and 80 ms, respectively.

- Which file formats are supported?
    + Currently only wavemark text files (which can be generated by Spike2) are supported. If you need support for other formats, do not hesitate to :ref:`contact us <contact_the_authors>`.

- How should I cite burstiDAtor?
    + See [OO13]_

- Under what license is burstiDAtor provided?
    + Under the MIT license (see :ref:`license`; the COPYING file in the source, or the 'about' section if you are using a Java archive (``burstiDAtor.jar``) file). We provide the software free of charge in the hope it will be useful, but do not provide any kind of warranty. The exact legal terms are described in the license, but it roughly means that you can use the software freely however you want and that you can share the program with others and/or improve on it, as long as you do not remove copyright notices and do not sue us for unexpected or undesired behaviour of the software.
